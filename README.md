# CppEngineer - A curious journey into the _web_

This was my *first* website. I started **cppengineer.com** out of **curiosity** of how to build a _website_ from scratch.

I decided to build a blog completely with login page and personal dashboard.

I even integrated google analytics.

I was able to post new articles using `markdown`, which was awesome.

Finally, I hosted it on **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)**.

This was an incredible journey and I'm looking forward to the next one.

If you want to know how to build a website with:
- **[PassportJS](https://www.passportjs.org/)** for user access and session control;
- blog website using **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** with **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**;
- server side rendering using the **[EJS](https://ejs.co/)** templates;
- nodejs integration with **Google Analytics**;
- email integration with **[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)**; and
- rendering **[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** with code markup to a webpage

Then checkout this repository.
